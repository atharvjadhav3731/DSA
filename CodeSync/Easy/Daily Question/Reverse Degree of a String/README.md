## Problem Description

Given a string s, calculate its reverse degree. The reverse degree is calculated as follows: For each character, multiply its position in the reversed alphabet ('a' = 26, 'b' = 25, ..., 'z' = 1) with its position in the string (1-indexed). Sum these products for all characters in the string. Return the reverse degree of s. Example 1: Input: s = "abc" Output: 148 Explanation: LetterIndex in Reversed AlphabetIndex in StringProduct'a'26126'b'25250'c'24372 The reversed degree is 26 + 50 + 72 = 148. Example 2: Input: s = "zaza" Output: 160 Explanation: LetterIndex in Reversed AlphabetIndex in StringProduct'z'111'a'26252'z'133'a'264104 The reverse degree is 1 + 52 + 3 + 104 = 160. Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 1000 s contains only lowercase English letters.
